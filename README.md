# Kinematic Planning for N-ball Toss Juggling

This repository contains an example of kinematic planning of task-space hand trajectories for toss juggling based on the code used in [Controlling the Cascade: Kinematic Planning for N-ball Toss Juggling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9981678).


Install `mujoco` and `casadi` using pip or conda and run `task_space_juggling.py`. Tested with Python 3.10, casadi 3.6.5, and mujoco 3.2.2.
